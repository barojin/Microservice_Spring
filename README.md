# Microservice_Spring
It has a two services Account and Post and one server Eureka.  
They were written using the Spring Boot, built with Gradle.  
Two services are made of Spring boot in MVC framework, and the service registry used the Netflix Eureka in Spring Cloud.

## Description
Account service stores the user's information and has a function for the CRUD.   
Post Service stores the posts that are generated by the user and posts are connected with user's id.
